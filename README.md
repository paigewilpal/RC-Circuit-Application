# RC-Circuit-Application
Solving RC Circuit Application using ode45 Solver
Solve the following using a MATLAB script.
The equation for the voltage, V, across the capacitor of an RC circuit is
𝑅Cdv/dt + V =Va
Where RC is the product of the resistance and the capacitance and V a is the applied voltage.
Suppose that RC=0.2, the applied voltage is 10 V, and the initial voltage on the capacitor is 2 V.
• Report the voltage after: 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 seconds (give values to 2 decimal places)
• How long does it take for the voltage to reach 8.0 Volts? (give answer to 2 decimal places)
• Plot the voltage V(t) for the first one second. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 10 V. Include
a grid, title, and axis labels
